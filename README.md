# Applying Filters to SQL queries

# Project description
My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job as a Cybersecurity analyst to ensure the system is safe, to  investigate all potential security issues and to update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.


# Retrieve after hours failed login attempts

We recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, we need to query the log_in_attempts table and review after hours login activity. 
We used filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. 
The success column in the log_in_attempts table contains values of TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the login was successful. 
MySQL stores Boolean values as 1 for TRUE, and 0 for FALSE. This means that TRUE is represented as 1, and FALSE represented as 0 in the success column.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours.

The first part of my screenshot is the query i used, and the second part is a portion of the output. 
This query filters for failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. 
First, I started by selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table. 
Then, I used a WHERE clause with an AND operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred after 18:00 and were unsuccessful. 
The first condition is login_time > '18:00', which filters for the login attempts that occurred after 18:00. 
The second condition is success = 0 or FALSE, which filters for the failed login attempts. 

# Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, we review all login attempts which occurred on this day and the day before. I used filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. (The date of the login attempt is found in the login_date column.)

The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query returns all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. First, I started by selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with an OR operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred on either 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. The first condition is login_date = '2022-05-09', which filters for logins on 2022-05-09. The second condition is login_date = '2022-05-08', which filters for logins on 2022-05-08.


# Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

After investigating the organizationâ€™s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico.

The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query returns all login attempts that occurred in countries other than Mexico. First, I started by selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with NOT to filter for countries other than Mexico. I used LIKE with MEX% as the pattern to match because the dataset represents Mexico as MEX and MEXICO. The percentage sign (%) represents any number of unspecified characters when used with LIKE.
